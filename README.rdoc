Generates strong yet user-friendly passwords using Ruby's secure random cryptographic functions.

You can change how passwords are created using the optional parameters and the return value is a string, so you can do string methods on it.

The default length is 12 characters, which is sufficiently strong for most web applications. You can make this stronger as needed.

The default character array is optimized for usability and accessibility, to help mobile phone users and people with disabilities: all letters are lowercase and letters that look like numbers (specifically, "i", "l", "o") are not used.

== Method
* new: optional, named parameters are length (integer) and alternate character set (array of characters, which forces the password to contain only characters from the passed array)

== Examples
  pt = PasswordText.new => "avzwbnxremcd"
  pt4 = PasswordText.new(:length => 4) => "avzw"
  pt4a = PasswordText.new(:length => 4, :chars => ['x','y','z']) => "yzyx"

== SecureRandom

Ruby 1.8.6 and older does not include a secure random number method so this gem checks to see if the SecureRandom class is defined and, if not, requires the webget_ruby_secure_random gem (http://github.com/webget/webget_ruby_secure_random).
